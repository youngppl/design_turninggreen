# Turning Green Design
Welcome üëãüèº! [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) files for Turning Green's footprint app are updated in this repository using a tool called [Kactus](https://kactus.io).

## View Designs
If you're a team member looking to view the designs you'll be able to find them on Zeplin [here](zpl.io/29oAKvY). You'll need to have a Zeplin account and join the project as a member.

## Getting Started
Kactus is used to version control Sketch files for this project to make sure that there is one source of truth and to make it easier to share designs. To get started:
1. Download [Kactus](https://kactus.io).
2. Log into Kactus with your Github account.
3. Click on the `Add` dropdown and selecting `Clone Repository`.
4. Under the *GitHub.com* tab find this repository (*design_turninggreen*), select and `Clone` it. This will add the selected repository to Kactus.
5. Under `Current Branch`, create and name a new branch. This branch will be where you will upload your work.
6. Switch the branch to the branch you just made and named. **Always check that you're on your own branch before starting to work üôèüèº.**
7. To open the Sketch file click the green `Open File` button.

After setting this up once, you won't need to do this again üéâ.

## Updating Designs
In addition to Kactus, you'll need Sketch to work on designs. Individual designers should be working on different pages in Sketch to reduce potential for merge conflicts. To contribute:
1. In Kactus `Fetch origin` to get the most up to date designs.
2. Make sure you're on your own personal branch under `Current Branch`. 
3. You can open the Sketch file either by clicking `Open File` button or just open Sketch how you normally would.
4. When you're finished working commit it in Kactus; add a summary at the bottom left detailing the changes you've made and click `commit to [your branch]`.
5. Click `Push origin` to upload changes to your branch on Github.
6. When you're ready to put the designs into the *master* branch of the repository (prior to design meetings) you'll need to go back to the repository on Github and create a pull request. 

Commits are usually done to document small changes (ie. centering dashboard layout), whereas pull requests are typically a set of commits that culminate in a feature or features added (ie. adding onboarding flow).

## Reviewing Designs
The `master` branch should only include approved designs that are the most up to date. To review designs remotely to merge into the `master` branch, you'll need Kactus and Sketch to view designs. Designs are typically reviewed during design meetings. If approved:
1. Designs should be merged into the master branch by merging the pull request. 
2. Designs should additionally be uploaded to Zeplin for handoff to engineers.

And you're done, fantastic job ‚òÄÔ∏è!
